<h3>This plugin will allow you to melt and speed up burn objects in a furnace with lava, which is located outside.</h3>

<h1>How use?</h1>
<p>Pour the complete lava blocks around the furnace. By default, the blocks located next to the furnace faces will act on the furnace and by default lava cannot start the melting process.</p>
